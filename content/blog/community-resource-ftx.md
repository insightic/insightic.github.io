## About
FTX was an international cryptocurrency exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang in 2019.
It grew to become one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, and at its peak, was valued at USD25b in 2021.
The rise of FTX came to a halt when a Nov 2022 CoinDesk report expressed risks of a collapse.
Nine days after the report, FTX entered and remains in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in the US court system.
