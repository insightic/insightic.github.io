We are thrilled to share that we are a mentored startup under a collaboration between Northern Trust and National University of Singapore’s Asian Institute of Digital Finance (“NUS AIDF”).

 - Northern Trust is one of the oldest and largest financial institutions in the world. Headquartered in the United States with operations across the globe, it provides asset servicing, asset  management and wealth management services.
   
 - NUS AIDF is a university-level institute jointly founded by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”), National Research Foundation (“NRF”) and NUS. It aims to develop leading Fintech research, technologies and talents.

This collaboration arrangement paves the way for us to combine industry expertise and mentorship from Northern Trust and NUS AIDF, with our technical expertise in digital assets risk assessment technology to develop industry-leading solutions for digital asset adoption.

At Insightic,  our vision is to help Regulators, Central Banks, and Financial Institutions simplify compliance assessment processes, mitigate risks, and enable a safer adoption of Web3 and digital asset innovations.

Stay tuned as we work closely together to develop innovative solutions for the space.
